Project 4 CS-2400

by Joshua Jenkins and Russell Rickards


- Use "data_random.txt" and "data_sorted.txt" files for any maxheaps that are wanted.
- For outputs, there are 4 output files, named respectively (i.e. the randomSequentialMaxHeap() method has the output file "outputFileSequentialRandom.txt" and for the sortedOptimalMaxHeap() method, the output file is "outputFileOptimalSorted.txt" and so on).
- Needs to use 100 numbers from the data_random and data_sorted files or else it will not work properly.
